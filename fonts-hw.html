          Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're

          instructions, they've moved to
           <a href="#" class="guide"> their own section</a>. Continue reading

        <p>
          React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS
          applications using React and <br />
          the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use
          JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs <br />
          APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI
          using React components: bundles <br />
          of reusable, nestable code. You can learn more about React in the next
          section. But first, let‚Äôs cover <br />
          how components work in React Native.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="fa react_fundamentals">
        <h1>REACT FUNDAMENTALS<span>Chapter 3</span></h1>
        <p>
          React Native runs on <a href="#" class="guide"> React</a>, a popular open source library for building
          user interfaces with <br />
          JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand
          React itself. This section can get <br />
          you started or can serve as a refresher course.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          <strong> + components</strong>. The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its
          examples: friendly, <br />
          approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
        <strong>+ JSX</strong>. React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write
          elements inside JavaScript like so: <br />
          <span class="span-backgound">
            <Text>Hello, I am your cat!</Text>.</span
          >
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          The React docs have a
          <a href="#" class="guide"> comprehensive guide to JSX</a> you can
          refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, <br />
          you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a
          <span class="span-backgound">name</span> for the cat, name, and <br />
          embedding it with curly braces inside <span class="span-backgound"><Text></span>
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> <strong> + props</strong>. Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            <strong>+ state</strong>. While you can think of props as arguments you use to
          configure how components render, <br />
          state is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for
          handling data that changes over <br />
          time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components
          memory!
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="fa text-input">
        <h1>HANDLING TEXT INPUT<span>Chapter 4</span></h1>
        <p>
          TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It
          has an <span class="italic">onChangeText</span> prop that <br />
          takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an
          onSubmitEditing prop that takes a <br />
          function to be called when the text is submitted.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating
          their words into a different language. <br />
          In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï.
          So the sentence "Hello there <br />
          Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".
